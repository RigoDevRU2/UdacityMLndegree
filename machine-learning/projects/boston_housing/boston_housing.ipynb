    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

Increasing the number of LSTAT would decrease the value, Increasing the PTRATIO would decrease the value. Factors such as number of rooms (assuming the size of the rooms is equal, we do not consider sqf as a feature), would increase the value of the house. Having a higher number of lower class workers in the neighborhood and a large classroom size (meaning large student to teacher ratio) would decrease the house value because it indicates lower income and lower education standards (subjective)."

If we use all the data to train, we can overfit the model to that specific data set. The model only remembers (recall and F1 score) the values presented (no learning here). We can have really good precision but bad accuracy. Low variance but high bias. If we use too few data points, we run to the risk of not capturing important features, that the model should be sensitive to, in the population we sampled the data from (underfitting). We can have high variance and low bias. Additionally, having a test set, allows for the comparison between multiple models, to see which one generalizes better (has a higher R2 score on the test set). This is valuable toward getting a model that actually represents the intrinsic transfer function, that exists in the solution space, sampled by the data (mapping inputs to outputs).  "

    "**Answer: ** Q4 a) - I would choose max_depth = 3. Q4 b) - Looking at the test set. The R2 score does not seem to improve much after max_depth = 3 (hovering around 0.70-0.80 visually). As we add more points the training score converges to 1, since we are asking the model to \"remember\" its data instances. The test score converges to a number between 0.70-0.80 in all cases after max_depth =3. This means that the model has an intrinsic limitation in its ability to generalize, even with more data the model is not able to extract more information from its given features to improve performance in the test set. Q4 c) Therefore, adding more training data will not improve the model's performance in terms of generalization with a topology of three or more decision splits."

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: ** Q5 a) - The model suffers from high variance at depth 1. Q5 b) - The model suffers from high bias at depth 10, because its training curve approaches higher and higher R2 values while its validation curve actually decreases with higher levels of uncertainty. This indicates that the model is \"memorizing” the data and cannot generalize well, it is BIASED towards capturing all the characteristics of this sampled data, including the intrinsic noise in the sampled data, which causes issues in validation. The model is more precise at mat_depth 10, but less accurate."

At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "**Answer: ** Q6 a) I would choose max_depth = 3. At this point we get the best score for accuracy in our validation without overcomplicating the model (i.e max_depth = 4). Q6 b) - Although our R2 is higher for max_depth = 4, this only means that the model is able to recall the training data better but our accuracy is not improved by much, regardless. Therefore, is best to use a less complicated model that approximates the target transfer function the same, because it makes the fewest assumptions about how to split the data into its decision paths. Anything after max_depth = 4 has lower accuracy in validation so it should be avoided as it is likely to not generalize well."

    "**Answer: **  Q7 a) It is a technique used to find the best hyperparameters for a specific model we are evaluation. Q7 b) The grid search method is used to explore how hyperparameters change the F1 score (or other metrics) on the model/models we want to apply to the sample data. It is literally a grid of values in which the columns and rows are combinations of hyperparameters used for that model. For example, in a deep neural network, these could be the number of cells and the activation function, we can design a topology for a Deep Neural Network of three layers, with 10-100 cells in each layer and using relu, tanh, sinh and linear activation functions, then construct at grid search in which one column is the number of cells 10, 20, 30 ... 100 and the other column is each activation function. Note that this can get really complicated, when we introduce combinations of layers, number of cells, interconnectivity (sparse, dense, etc.) and different activation functions for each layer. The idea is the same though, one can construct a grid search matrix for each of the different combination of hyperparameters in N dimensions."

    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that.

    "**Answer: ** Q8 a) K-fold cross-validation is a technique of dividing our training and testing sets into K sub sections and training on each one, while testing on the other, at random, then average the results of the training. Note that we need to train K times, to cover all possible combinations. So, let’s say I divide my data of 100 samples into 80-20 split. I take the firt 80 points and train a model, then test on the other 20. Then I k fold the data into 5 buckets (K =5), so I now take the first 20 values and the last 60 values and train on that, then test on the remaining 20 (in between the first 20 and last 60) and so forth. This method is a similar idea to a sliding window method in which we slide a window of a certain width around the data set, whatever falls inside the window we use to test, the rest is used to train. Q8 b) k-Fold Cross validation reduces the variance in our model, by doing so we can be more confident that the hyperparameters found by grid search are actually the optimal for describing the transfer function that maps input to outputs for the provided data. Without cross validation, we can say that the hyperparameters are the best found for that specific train/text split subset, but not for all possible combinations. This reduces overfitting by approximating the noise in the data, since there is a variance cancellation in the cross validation step, we also get hyperparameters that are less sensitive to the particular variance of this specific data. Therefore, they are likely to generalize better."

To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

However, grid search is a mathematical approach to hyperparameter tuning, that, in this case is not penalized by model complexity, so it has no sensitivity to that metric, while all others are constant."

The data is outdated, there is no accounting for inflation, the three features that were used to train the model do not account for a number of important factors (such as square feet, lot size, waterfront, age of the property, roof condition, appliances condition, pool and so many others). The model is not robust enough to make persistent predictions since we had a 73,000 deviation, that is about 10% changes in prediction without any change to the input features. This means the model is underdamped (it oscillates around a local minimum in the solution space). The characteristics of the city are not considered (population density per square mile). Finally, one house cannot be price solely on the characteristics of its neighborhood. A more likely approach is to look for comparative houses (K-nearest neighbor) and see what prices those houses are going for. Maybe even do a historical price search around the area for all the houses sold and bought (this is public record) and perform a combination of K-nearest neighbor with a multiple regression extrapolation that accounts for inflation and property tax increases.\n",
