    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: ** Q1 - I would expect that increasing the number of rooms would increase the median value (MEDV). Increasing the number of LSTAT would decrease the value, Increasing the PTRATIO would decrease the value. Factors such as number of rooms (assuming the size of the rooms is equal, we do not consider sqf as a feature), would increase the value of the house. Having a higher number of lower class workers in the neighborhood and a large classroom size (meaning large student to teacher ratio) would decrease the house value because it indicates lower income and lower education standards (subjective)."

This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how \"good\" that model is at making predictions. \n",

A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "**Answer:** Q2 a) - Yes. The R2 score is a measure of goodness of fit by accounting for the proportion of the variance between the predicted target values (Predictions) and the actual values (True Value). R2 accounts for the distance between what the data is and what our model is telling us it should be, letting us know how likely is it that the variance from our target (Y) is predictable by our model from input (X). Q2 b)- The R2 score is 0.923 or 92.3% of the variance of the dependent variable (Y) in the sample, can be predicted from the independent variable (X) using the model we created. This means that our model has accounted for 92.3% of the variance in the dependent variable. Therefore 92.3% of the points will fall close to the regression line that can be made between the true values and the predicted values. See graph below for further clarification."

    "**Answer: ** Q3 - By splitting the data into a train and test subsets we can estimate the ability of the model to generalize because we can exercise the model on data it has not been trained on and see what happens. If we use all the data to train, we can overfit the model to that specific data set. The model only remembers (recall and F1 score) the values presented (no learning here). We can have really good precision but bad accuracy. Low variance but high bias. If we use too few data points, we run to the risk of not capturing important features, that the model should be sensitive to, in the population we sampled the data from (underfitting). We can have high variance and low bias. Additionally, having a test set, allows for the comparison between multiple models, to see which one generalizes better (has a higher R2 score on the test set). This is valuable toward getting a model that actually represents the intrinsic transfer function, that exists in the solution space, sampled by the data (mapping inputs to outputs).  "

    "In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `'max_depth'` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased.

    "**Answer: ** Q4 a) - I would choose max_depth = 3. Q4 b) - Looking at the test set, the R2 score does not seem to improve much after max_depth = 3 (hovering around 0.70-0.80 visually). As we add more points the training score converges to 1 but there is litle improvement on the model performance in the test set.

Q7 b) The grid search method is used to explore how hyperparameters change the F1 score (or other metrics) on the model/models we want to apply to the sample data. It is literally a grid of values in which the columns and rows are combinations of hyperparameters used for that model. For example, in a deep neural network, these could be the number of cells and the activation function, we can design a topology for a Deep Neural Network of three layers, with 10-100 cells in each layer and using relu, tanh, sinh and linear activation functions, then construct at grid search in which one column is the number of cells 10, 20, 30 ... 100 and the other column is each activation function. Note that this can get really complicated, when we introduce combinations of layers, number of cells, interconnectivity (sparse, dense, etc.) and different activation functions for each layer. The idea is the same though, one can construct a grid search matrix for each of the different combination of hyperparameters in N dimensions."

    "**Answer: ** Q8 a) K-fold cross-validation is a technique of dividing our training set into K sub sections and training on randomly selected K-1 of those sections, while validating on the remaining one. Then we repeat the training upon selecting another set of sections of K-1 and so forth. each time with a validation set different from the previous one. Then averaging the results of the training to check the performance of the model. Note that we need to train K times, to cover all possible combinations. So, let’s say I divide my data of 120 samples into 100 points for training and 20 points for testing. Then I take my training set of 100 points and do a 80-20 split. I take the first 80 points and train a model, then validate on the other 20. Then I k fold the data into 5 buckets (K = 5), so I now take the first 20 values and the last 60 values and train on that, then validate on the remaining 20 (in between the first 20 and last 60) and so forth. This method is a similar idea to a sliding window, in which we slide a window of a certain width around the data set, whatever falls inside the window we use to validate, the rest is used to train. Q8 b) K-Fold Cross validation allows for all the training data to be used for training the model, without making the model biased toward an arbitrarily selected training and validation set. In K-Fold CV we sweep through the entire training set. This makes us more confident that the hyperparameters found by grid search are actually the best possible for describing the transfer function that maps input to outputs for the provided data. Without cross validation, we can say that the hyperparameters are the best found for that specific train/validation split subset, but not for all possible combinations. Therefore, the model is likely to generalize better for hyperparameters found with K-fold cross validation metrics. Once the best parameters have been selected via grid search with k-fold cross-validated metrics for our model, we can use the test set (20 points we set aside at the beginning) to check model performance on previously unseen data."

The model is not robust enough to make persistent predictions since we had a 73,000 deviation, that is about 10% changes in prediction without any change to the input features. This means the model is underdamped (it oscillates around a local minimum in the solution space). The characteristics of the city are not considered (population density per square mile). Finally, one house cannot be price solely on the characteristics of its neighborhood. A more likely approach is to look for comparative houses (K-nearest neighbor) and see what prices those houses are going for. Maybe even do a historical price search around the area for all the houses sold and bought (this is public record) and perform a combination of K-nearest neighbor with a multiple regression extrapolation that accounts for inflation and property tax increases.\n",
